<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Here's a brief bio on me. I'm currently in Year 8 at the time of writing at Werribee Secondary School.
My highest ever GPS is <u>3.82</u>. I think of myself as a very good mathematician and a good reader, if I do say so myself.
My favourite foods are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Pizza</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi">Sushi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger">Burgers</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen">Ramen</a>, all tied for first place. I take private piano lessons and I play basketball with my dad
on the weekends.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I have a few hobbies. One of them is playing the piano, which now that I think about it, is less of a hobby and more of a requirement.
I like playing video games, especially with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend">my friends</a> They like to call me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity">nicknames</a>. I also have grown a habit of doing a couple of Duolingo lessons everyday, and playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a>.
